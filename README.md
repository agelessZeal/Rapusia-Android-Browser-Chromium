### Introduction

This browser is based on the chromium open source.

The customer can build the chromium source using ninja and gn configuration for each platform: android, ios, iMac, windows and linux.

But there is not some limit to customize the chromium as you want.

For the android platform, I have converted the chromium ninja project into android gradle project.

So it is easy to customize the chromium for the native android developers who is experienced with java.

### Features.

This browser has only dedicated search engine.
Only one search engine is possibile in this app.
The config of it is writen in the chormium engine source with c++.
